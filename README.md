# Feeder Mapping Project

This project simulates and evaluates meter-to-feeder mappings in electrical grids using synthetic data.

## Structure

- `feeder_mapping/`: Main package with the logic for generating synthetic data and evaluating mappings.
- `main.py`: Entry point to run a full simulation.
- `data/clean_data.csv`: Input CSV file with smart meter data (not included here).
- `tests/`: Unit tests.

## How to Run

```bash
python main.py
